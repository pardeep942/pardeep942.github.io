*My  backround is accouting and i have 6 years of expecience in Accouting Firm, but when i have seen my husband working as java developer and solving issues and coding ,i was very impressed and want a change in my life ,so i have decided to quit my accouting job and start searching for short courses so i don't have to spend years,then i found Flatirian School and got admission , I am trying my best to complete this course so i can get a job in IT industry and become a Software Developer . I know that i will face alot of difculties because i don't know anything about coding ,but i will give my 100% to get sucess in this course.
