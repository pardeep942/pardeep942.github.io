*My  backround is accouting and i have 6 years of expecience in Accouting Firm, but when i  saw  my husband working as java developer and solving issues and coding ,i was very impressed and wanted to make change in my career ,so i have decided to quit my accouting job and started searching for short courses ,so i don't have to spend years on IT course ,then i found Flatiron School  and here i am  .. I am trying my best to complete this course ,so i can get a good job in IT industry and become a Software Developer . I know that i will face alot of problems , because i don't know anything about coding ,but i will give my 100% to compete this course.
